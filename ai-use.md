# Fairness and Integrity in the Use of AI

Some of the content in the codebase and this report were generated and modified using artificial intelligence (AI) models. Specifically, the following models were applied: *Claude Sonnet 3.7* and *Gemini 2.5 Pro*.
The responsible use of AI was guaranteed and directed by human intuition and ideas. The content generated by the aforementioned AI models was meticulously reviewed, verified, corrected, and cross-referenced with existing knowledge. The same level of caution and responsibility is expected of anyone who will use any code or content in this report in a production environment, particularly if it will directly affect human lives or any property.


# Prompts

> The original code for code segment 25 is wrong since it plots the wrong dataset. A different LLM suggested two methods, so I was just trying them out (code segments 25A and 25B).
In code segment 25A, the plot looks like this: [image]
But in 25B, the data was normalized due to some error and the plot looks like this: [image]
The plot doesn't look good though. I think plotting a best fit line is possible in the first image and would look better. How would I do it?

> Please help me understand what the original code was really meant to do here. The current file in context is the original code. I know segment #25 is wrong since it plots the wrong data. However, #24 uses sklearn's built-in model.fit() function to build a regression model unlike in the first linear regression (segments #1-#19), though it also uses the wrong data X and y instead of X2 and y2. How should I proceed from there if I want to correct the code and build a linear regression model with multiple variables using the X2 and y2 data?

> I'm creating a methodology section that documents the things I've done to correct the code. The python file in context 'lab2-1_python.py' contains the original code while the jupyter notebook 'linreg.ipynb' contains the corrected code. Please explain each code segment and describe the changes made to correct the codes in that segment if applicable.

> Discuss the results in the first regression exercise. Refer to the attached images (predicted profit vs population size and error vs training epoch).

Also generate code where I can see the performance metrics of this first regression model, and also print the model's formula (y=mx+b)

> Code segments 24-25 produce these warnings respectively:

What can you suggest to avoid those warnings? [file_context]

> Ammend code segment 5 and plot the transformed data points with the sigmoid function, similar to the plot of the first attached image. Also generate modifications to segment 15 to properly display other relevant metrics for the first logistic regression exercise.
